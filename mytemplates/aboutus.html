    <p style="margin-left:10px; padding-top: 10px;  color: #008CBA;">The Django web framework is a free, open source framework that can speed up development of a web application being built in the Python programming language. 
     Django—pronounced “Jango,” named after the famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt—is a free, open source framework that was first publicly released in 2005. 
     Django facilitates “rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.” 
     The Django web framework, deployed on a web server, can help developers quickly produce a web frontend that’s feature-rich, secure and scalable.
    Starting with the Django web framework is more efficient way to build a web app than starting from scratch, which requires building the backend, APIs, javascript and sitemaps.
     With the Django web framework, web developers can focus on creating a unique application and benefit from greater flexibility than using a web development tool.
     In 2003, Django was an internal project started by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison.
     The first version of Django was released in July 2005, and the name is given Django based on the name of guitarist Django Reinhardt.
     In 2005, Django was capable of handling high traffic on sites.
     The current stable version of Django is 2.2.5, which was released in April 2019. 
     Presently, the version of Django is 2.2.5(LTS) and is made available to everyone as an open-source project where contributors from all over the world can contribute to its development. 
     There is also a new version available such as Django 3.0a1 which is in its beta release. Users who want to try the newer version and find bugs in this version can use this version as well.</p>
